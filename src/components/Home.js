        <p>
          I'm a curious and driven Software Developer and UI/UX Designer based
          in Cebu City, Philippines. My journey in tech is driven by a desire to
          solve real-world problems with elegant code and user-centered design.
          From developing scalable backend systems to designing pixel-perfect
          interfaces in Figma, I thrive on turning complex challenges into
          seamless digital experiences.
